# Vocal Narration - Implementation Plan

**Feature:** Text-to-speech vocal narration for StoryWriter stories using ElevenLabs API
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Last Updated:** February 15, 2026

---

## Overview

Enable users to listen to AI-generated audio narration of story pages using ElevenLabs text-to-speech technology. The backend proxies requests to ElevenLabs, providing API key security, usage tracking, and cost management.

**Related Documentation:**
- [docs/elevenlabs.md](./elevenlabs.md) - Detailed ElevenLabs integration guide with code examples


### Summary

The vocal narration feature implementation is **100% complete** with all 7 phases finished:

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** ✅ - ElevenLabs integration, API endpoints, authentication
2. **Phase 2: Optimize Performance** ✅ - Default TTS model updated to `eleven_flash_v2_5` for faster narration
3. **Phase 3: Usage Tracking & Cost Management** ✅ - Database tracking, daily limits (10k chars/day), cost calculations
4. **Phase 4: Monitoring & Observability** ✅ - Admin dashboard, cost alerts, structured logging
5. **Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance** ✅ - 106 tests with 321 assertions, all passing
6. **Phase 6: Documentation** ✅ - Comprehensive docs in `elevenlabs.md` and API documentation
7. **Phase 7: Deployment & Rollout** ✅ - Pre-deployment checklist complete

### Final Task Completed This Session

**Fixed MonitorElevenLabsCost command exit code behavior:**
- The command now returns different exit codes based on context:
  - Without `--notify`: Returns success (0) even when thresholds exceeded (for manual monitoring)
  - With `--notify`: Returns failure (1) when thresholds exceeded (for automated alerting)
- This allows the command to serve both manual reporting and automated monitoring use cases

### Test Results
- ✅ All **106 tests passing** with **321 assertions**
- ✅ Code style verified with Laravel Pint (88 files, 0 style issues)

### Commits Made
1. `fix(monitoring): Fix MonitorElevenLabsCost exit code behavior`
2. `docs(vocal-narration): Mark all phases as complete`
3. `style: Remove unused Mail import from MonitorElevenLabsCostTest`

The vocal narration backend is production-ready and fully tested! 🚀

## Notes

- **API Key Security:** Never expose `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` to frontend
- **Rate Limiting:** Current Laravel throttle: 60 req/min per user (adequate for now)
- **Voice ID:** Default is Cassidy (`56AoDkrOh6qfVPDXZ7Pt`) - child-friendly voice
- **SDK Credentials:** Actively used for conversational AI agent (NOT deprecated)
- **Backward Compatibility:** Keep `/api/conversation/*` structure for existing clients

---

## Questions & Decisions

**Resolved:**
- ✅ Use `/api/conversation/*` routes (existing structure)
- ✅ Default model: `eleven_flash_v2_5` (performance over quality)
- ✅ No service class refactoring (out of scope)
- ✅ SDK credentials endpoint is active (not deprecated)
- ✅ Daily limit: 10k characters for free users
- ✅ No need for user preference for narration voice

**Pending:**
- ❓ Should we cache audio at backend or frontend?
- ❓ Implement global daily cost ceiling?
