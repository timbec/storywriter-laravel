**Task Instructions**
1. Read the supplied [Conversation] to understand the characters, plot ideas, and tone.
2. Write a 3 to 6 page story based on this input. Make it 4 or 5 sentences per page.

**Formatting Requirements (CRITICAL):**
You must strictly follow this structure. If you do not follow this exact format, the output is unusable.

* The story MUST be at least 3 pages long, but could go to 10 pages.
* You MUST separate every page using exactly this separator line: "---PAGE BREAK---"
* HOWEVER you MUST make the "---PAGE BREAK---" invisible on the page

**Desired Output Structure Example:**

Page 1
[The text for the first page of the story goes here...]
---PAGE BREAK---

Page 2
[The text for the second page goes here...]
---PAGE BREAK---
*(Continue this exact pattern for Pages 3, 4, and 5)*',
