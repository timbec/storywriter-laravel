# Security Fixes Applied - Summary

**Date:** January 19, 2026
**Status:** ✅ All Critical Security Fixes Applied

## Successfully Applied Changes

### 1. ✅ Terraform State Management
- **Bootstrap Configuration Created**: `terraform/bootstrap/`
- **S3 Bucket**: `storywriter-terraform-state`
  - Versioning enabled
  - Encryption enabled (AES256)
  - Public access blocked
  - Lifecycle protection enabled
- **DynamoDB Table**: `storywriter-terraform-locks`
  - State locking enabled
  - Prevents concurrent Terraform runs
  - Pay-per-request billing

### 2. ✅ SSH Access Restricted
**Before:** SSH open to entire internet (0.0.0.0/0)
**After:** SSH restricted to specific IP (100.37.141.157/32)

- **Staging Security Group**: `sg-001cd69a98738fd7d`
- **Production Security Group**: `sg-05d4cdec9d690ebb0`

**To add more IPs:** Edit tfvars files and add to `allowed_ssh_cidrs` list:
```hcl
allowed_ssh_cidrs = ["100.37.141.157/32", "another-ip/32"]
```

### 3. ✅ IMDSv2 Enforced
**Both environments now have:**
- `http_tokens = "required"` (IMDSv2 mandatory)
- `http_put_response_hop_limit = 1`
- `instance_metadata_tags = "enabled"`

This protects against SSRF attacks targeting instance metadata.

### 4. ✅ Sudo Permissions Tightened
**Before:** `deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ...`
**After:** `deploy ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ...`

Implements least privilege principle for the deploy user.

### 5. ✅ State File Path Standardization
**Before:**
- Staging: `backend-staging/terraform.tfstate`
- Production: `environments/prod/terraform.tfstate`

**After:**
- Staging: `environments/staging/terraform.tfstate`
- Production: `environments/prod/terraform.tfstate`

State files migrated successfully.

### 6. ✅ Terraform Workflow Fixed
**File:** `.github/workflows/terraform-staging.yml`
**Fix:** Corrected working directory from `terraform` to `terraform/environments/staging`

### 7. ✅ Deployment Health Checks Enforced
**Files:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml`

**Changes:**
- Failed health checks now fail the deployment (`exit 1`)
- Increased wait time from 2s to 5s
- Changed to use HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Deployments won't be marked successful if health check fails

### 8. ✅ Production Approval Gate Added
**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml`

Added environment configuration:
```yaml
environment:
  name: production
  url: https://prod.storywriter.net
```

## Infrastructure Status

- **Domain**: `staging-api.storywriter.net`
- **Security Group**: `sg-001cd69a98738fd7d`
- **Status**: ✅ Security fixes applied and verified

### Production Environment
- **Instance ID**: `i-073488218b4d18499`
- **Elastic IP**: `44.210.27.168`
- **Domain**: `prod.storywriter.net`
- **Security Group**: `sg-05d4cdec9d690ebb0`
- **Status**: ✅ Security fixes applied and verified

## ⚠️ Action Still Required

### 1. Configure GitHub Environment Protection
**IMPORTANT:** Manual approval for production deployments is configured in the workflow, but you need to enable it in GitHub:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/timbec/storywriter-laravel/settings/environments`
2. Click on **production** environment
3. Check **Required reviewers**
4. Add team members who must approve production deployments
5. Optionally set a wait timer (e.g., 5 minutes minimum)

Without this configuration, production deployments will still run automatically.

### 2. Test SSH Access
Verify you can still SSH into both environments:

```bash
# Staging
ssh ubuntu@34.194.100.158

# Production
ssh ubuntu@44.210.27.168
```

If you need to add more IPs, edit the tfvars files and run `terraform apply`.

### 3. Test Deployments
- Push to `develop` branch to test staging deployment
- Push to `main` branch to test production deployment (should require approval once configured)

## Additional Security Recommendations (Not Yet Implemented)

### High Priority
1. **Move SSH Keys to AWS Secrets Manager**
   - Currently hardcoded in user-data.sh
   - Should be stored in AWS Parameter Store or Secrets Manager

2. **Store Database Credentials in Secrets Manager**
   - Currently written to plaintext files on server
   - Should use AWS Secrets Manager with IAM role access

3. **Implement Automated Database Backups**
   - Set up cron job to backup PostgreSQL to S3
   - Configure retention policy

4. **Add CloudWatch Monitoring**
   - Instance health monitoring
   - Application error alerting
   - CPU/Memory/Disk usage alerts

5. **Create Production Terraform Workflow**
   - Currently only staging has a Terraform workflow
   - Production needs one with manual approval for apply/destroy

### Medium Priority
6. Add automated rollback on deployment failure
7. Consolidate duplicate deployment workflow code (create reusable workflow)
8. Implement comprehensive resource tagging strategy
9. Create `.gitignore` entries for sensitive tfvars files
10. Create `terraform.tfvars.example` files

### Security Best Practices
11. Enable VPC Flow Logs
12. Enable AWS GuardDuty
13. Enable EBS encryption by default (account-wide)
14. Automate SSL certificate management with certbot
15. Set up Laravel queue workers with systemd

## Next Deployment Behavior

### Staging (on push to `develop`)
1. Build job runs (builds application)
2. Deploy job runs automatically
3. Health check runs (fails deployment if not 200/302)
4. Deployment marked successful only if health check passes

### Production (on push to `main`)
1. Build job runs (builds application)
2. Deploy job **waits for approval** (once GitHub environment is configured)
3. After approval, deployment proceeds
4. Health check runs (fails deployment if not 200/302)
5. Deployment marked successful only if health check passes

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Review the comprehensive code review output from this session
- Check `DEPLOYMENT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` for detailed implementation notes
- Review `terraform/bootstrap/README.md` for bootstrap details

## Summary

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed and applied to both staging and production environments. Your infrastructure is now significantly more secure with:
- Restricted SSH access
- State locking to prevent corruption
- IMDSv2 protection against SSRF
- Least privilege sudo permissions
- Enforced health checks
- Production approval gates (pending GitHub configuration)

The infrastructure is ready for production use with these security improvements in place.
